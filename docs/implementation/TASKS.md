# Atomic Task Backlog

This is the active task and dependency registry. Together with [the completed archive](archive/TASKS-DONE.md), it is the single registry: each ID has exactly one row. Each row represents one bounded deliverable. [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) owns milestone goals; task cards in `tasks/<ID>.md` own execution details. Registry rows own status, owner, dependencies, scope summary, result summary, and primary check. Cards never duplicate these fields.

## Registry Rules

- IDs are stable (`FND-001`, then area-specific sequences); never reuse an ID. Group rows by milestone.
- Create cards using [tasks/TEMPLATE.md](tasks/TEMPLATE.md). Link the ID once its card exists; keep unplanned IDs as plain text rather than broken links.
- **Scope** describes the bounded change, not permission to overwrite unrelated work. **Result** records actual completion, not the intended outcome. **Check** is a verification entry point; the card supplies full acceptance and evidence.
- Use `—` for no owner/dependencies/result. A descriptive check for a DRAFT must become an executable command or explicit reproducible manual check before READY. Never invent a passing test or unavailable command.
- Dependencies reference registered IDs in the active registry or completed archive and must form an acyclic graph. All dependencies must be DONE before READY or ACTIVE. If a prerequisite is reopened, dependent pending work returns to DRAFT or BLOCKED for reassessment.
- Split work that spans unrelated results or cannot be verified independently. Future milestones remain in ROADMAP until the planner can define bounded tasks.

## Status Lifecycle

| Status | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| DRAFT | Planning candidate; card, acceptance, dependencies, or check still needs preparation |
| READY | Card exists; scope, acceptance, check and required decisions are clear; dependencies DONE |
| ACTIVE | Claimed by an identifiable owner and being executed |
| BLOCKED | Cannot proceed; card records reason and unblock condition |
| DONE | Acceptance verified; result and evidence recorded |

Normal path: `DRAFT → READY → ACTIVE → DONE`. BLOCKED returns to READY when its blocker is resolved and dependencies are satisfied. Set an owner when moving to ACTIVE; no concurrent ownership is implied. Move completed rows to the archive during a milestone handoff; keep pending rows active and card paths stable. This is a manual documentation convention; harness scheduling and automation will be designed separately.

## M6 — External Plugin Runtime

All 33 M6 tasks (001–032 plus audit follow-up 033) are verified DONE and retained in the [completed registry](archive/TASKS-DONE.md#m6--external-plugin-runtime). See [acceptance/handoff](M6-HANDOFF.md), [offline operations](LOCAL-M6.md) and [integration guide](M6-INTEGRATION.md). The five older live gates above remain active under their existing requirements.
